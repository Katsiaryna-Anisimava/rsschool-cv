## About me

*I went to school with a focus on chemistry and biology. Accordingly, these subjects determined my future career, but while studying at the university I realized that this is not what I want to do.
I had a long way to find a case "for the soul". Now I am painstakingly and diligently studying programming and I get great pleasure from the process*
